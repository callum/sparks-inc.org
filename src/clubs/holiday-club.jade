          p Each week, Holiday Club has a different theme - such as Bollywood, Vintage Sports, Circus Skills, and Japanese Pop Culture - and the upcoming Easter Holiday Club will be centred around the theme of Nature.
          p The warmer springtime weather will offer the chance to get out and about on forest-school trips, allowing the children to explore the local wildlife and get involved with team-building tasks, such as cooking around the campfire and building dens.
          p Booking for the Easter Holiday Club will open on the 14th of March. Get your booking in between the 14th and 31st of March to benefit from our early bird 10% discount!
