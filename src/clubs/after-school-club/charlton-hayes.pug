          p We will have the use of a classroom exclusively for Sparks which we decorate and personalise. The children love to get creative and put the Sparks stamp on our room.
          p Thereâ€™s always planned cooking and crafting activities that the children can choose to take part in. The arts and crafts table is always popular where they can make and invent colourful creations.
          p We encourage the children to #[a(href=pageUrl('blog/benefits-of-free-play.pug')) free play] as much as possible and we provide lots of toys and games to spark their imaginations. Small toys such as Lego and dinosaurs are always popular. Den building is a fantastic way for them to immerse themselves in their own make believe world.
          p There is a large playground that the children can explore and run around to blow off steam or play ball games after school. We try to offer a variety of activities each day and the playworkers have a range of differing skills to bring to After School Club.
