            p “I love working with Children because they’re so incredibly full of fun and energy, even first thing in the morning! I enjoy being up bright and early and making sure the children have had a hearty breakfast, and give them the opportunity to get messy, creative or just make noise! 
            p “I particularly enjoy working outdoors, being in nature and giving the children lots of freedom and choices.
            p “The Scout Hut is the perfect base for Breakfast Club as it has loads of space for the children to run around and play inside and out. Our crafting table is also very popular with many children opting to start the day by expressing themselves creatively. 
            p “The children love choosing their own breakfasts. We always have a variety of items on offer, including seasonal breakfast treats like pancakes on Pancake Day and hot cross buns leading up to Easter! The children really enjoy being able to choose their own activities too, and often make up new and original games or twists on the ones we already know. 
            p “One of the things I love most about Breakfast Club is seeing the children come together to work towards a common goal. They all play together regardless of age and which school they’re from so it’s wonderful to see friendships blossom between children who otherwise may not have ever met if it weren’t for Sparks.”

          p Here’s what some of the children told us they like most about Sparks Breakfast Club in their own words.

          p We take a child-led approach to everything we do at Sparks, and Breakfast Club is no exception. We provide scrumptious and nutritious morning meals, including cereal, porridge, toast, fruit, yogurt, crumpets and fruit bread. New from April 18 Children can make their own fruit smoothies.
          p We educate the children as to the importance of having a healthy, balanced breakfast, but what they choose to eat is entirely up to them.

          p Even though Breakfast Club is shorter than our #[a(href=pageUrl('clubs/after-school-club/index.pug')) After School Club], there’s still plenty of fun to be had. We don’t run specifically scheduled activities, but we provide various toys, games and equipment for the children to indulge in #[a(href=pageUrl('blog/benefits-of-free-play.pug')) free-play]. This helps stimulate creativity and independence, as they’re able to take charge of how they spend their hour before school.
          p Breakfast Club is held at #[a(href=pageUrl('clubs/index.pug') + '#locations') The Scout Hut] next to Sefton Park Primary School, which provides quiet areas for reading or drawing, as well as space to run around and let off steam before school begins. 
          p After tucking into brekkie, the children are free to get involved with: 
          ul
            li Art activities
            li Junk modelling 
            li Quiet reading 
            li Board games 
            li Sports equipment
            li Outdoor play
          p Everyone helps tidy up at 08:20, and then we walk in groups to Brunel Fields and Sefton Park, arriving in plenty of time before school begins.
