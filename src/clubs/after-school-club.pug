          p At the end of the school day, our After School clubbers are collected from their classrooms by one of our friendly playworkers.
          p Upon arrival, everyone is offered a yummy, scrummy healthy snack, with a menu consisting of: toast, crumpets, wraps, rice cakes, cheese and crackers, and a selection of fruit and veg. Juice and water is also available throughout the session.

          p After snack time, everyone is free to play or chill out until tidy up time at 17:30. All children must then be picked up by 18:00.

          h2 Things to do
          p We champion #[a(href=pageUrl('blog/benefits-of-free-play.pug')) free play] and a child-led approach to care at Sparks, so everyone is encouraged to choose how they wish to spend their afternoons with us. We organise fun craft activities, games and cooking sessions each day, inviting the children to participate, although there is never any pressure to join in. There are also plenty of other resources and play equipment available, as well as quiet areas for reading and relaxing.
