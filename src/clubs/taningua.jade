          h1 Taningua
          p Taningua is Sparks’ new club created for Big Sparks and teenagers aged 9-14 years in 2012. The club gives the older children at Sparks the opportunity to hang out with children their age and participate in more challenging and stimulating activities geared around this age group.

          h2 What to expect
          p Taningua was set up by the older children as they were bored with normal holiday activities. The name ‘Taningua’ is Icelandic for teenager and this club mainly runs in the Summer holidays. Taningua runs on the same premises as Sparks Holiday club but mainly the young people go out and about to do their exciting activities. Please see list below for examples of activities that we have planned and run over the last couple of years. Taningua can be booked through Libacura when available.
