          p One of the things parents and children love about our clubs is that there’s always plenty of equipment and activities to entertain everyone! At Sparks, we promote a culture of inclusion and it’s great to see children of varying ages and abilities getting together, interacting with one another and enjoying activities as a group.
          p However, we believe in giving children the #[a(href=pageUrl('blog/benefits-of-free-play.pug')) freedom to choose how they play] and spend their leisure time, so Taningua provides an alternative environment that is especially designed for bigger Sparks.
          p Away from the little ones, the older children are free to explore more challenging activities, sophisticated cooking classes and more intricate crafting tasks. Day trips are also a little more adventurous, from climbing the rigging of the SS Great Britain to ceramic painting at #[a(href='http://www.flyingsaucers.co.uk/') Flying Saucers] pottery cafe. 
          p In 2012, we asked the children to come up with a name for this exciting new club, and Taningua was settled upon because it means ‘Teenager’ in Icelandic. An ice cool name for an ice cool club.
