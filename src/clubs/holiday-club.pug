          h2 Our ethos
          p At Sparks, we believe the school holidays should be about meeting new people, learning new skills, being active and, most importantly,  having bundles of fun!
          p We offer a safe environment where your children can play freely inside and out, with a variety of optional planned activities to choose from each day.

        section
