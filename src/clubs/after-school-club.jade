      h1.club__heading After School Club
      p.club__body After School Club is where kids come to have fun and wind down after a busy day at school. It’s our most-loved club and has been providing after school care since 1982. We now have up to 65 children a day with 8 trained playworkers to support them.

      h2.club__subheading What to expect
      p.club__body After arriving at Sparks children have the option of a healthy snack. Choices include things like toast, crumpets, fruit, juice and/or water*. They’re then free to get stuck in to an evening of play… or rest!
