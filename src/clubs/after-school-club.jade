          p.intro__body After School Club is where kids come to have fun and wind down after a busy day at school. It’s our most-loved club and has been providing after school care since 1982. We now have up to 65 children a day with 8 trained playworkers to support them.

          h2 What to expect
          p Most children are collected at the end of their school day from their classrooms. Infants from Sefton Park are collected from their classrooms by a playworker and juniors make their own way to Sparks.
          p After arriving at Sparks children have the option of a healthy snack. Choices include toast, crumpets, wraps, rice cakes, cheese and crackers and a selection of fruit & vegetables. There is also juice and water available throughout the evening session. They’re then free to get stuck in to an evening of play… or rest!
          p Sparks have loads of play resources for children to choose from and they are free to do the things they would like to do. Tidy Up time is at 17:30 and all children are expected to participate.
