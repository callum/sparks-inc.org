          p Sparks Play & Care cares for school children aged 3 to 14 years in Bristol. Our family of passionate and qualified playworkers work together to provide a variety of clubs during term time and holidays.
          p At Sparks we provide a safe and flexible environment for children that offers a wide range of fun and stimulating play opportunities to aid their growth and development. We enable them to experiment and express themselves, but most of all… to have fun!!
          p We value individuality and diversity and are proud to provide an equal-opportunity setting. We are committed to maintaining a supportive, friendly and inclusive environment for all.
          p Sparks underpins all of its work with an a ethical code drawn up by Play Wales called #[a(href='//www.playwales.org.uk/eng/playworkprinciples') The Playwork Principles]. These eight principles have been endorsed nationally as good practice for all playworkers by SkillsActive and Ofsted.
          p All of our regular staff are trained playworkers with necessary DBS checks. We are also fully registered with #[a(href='//reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/CARE/EY376224') Ofsted].

          h2 Our background
          p In April 2005 Sparks Play & Care became Bristol’s first ever childcare workers’ co-operative after taking over the existing After School Club which had been run by a committee of parents. From here our mission was to provide a variety of services that could meet and respond to the needs of local families. We do this by offering flexible, safe and affordable childcare that families know they can count on.
          p Our clubs present opportunities to children that are second to none which really make a difference to their lives. We offer creative wrap-around care where children play, take risks and are kept safe.
          p There are currently 142 families actively using Sparks’ services for 205 children. We have an excellent track record in supporting families with additional needs as we run an inclusive play setting.
