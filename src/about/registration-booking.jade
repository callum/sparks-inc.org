          p Before you register with us we encourage you to come and visit Sparks so that you and your children can meet us and have a look around to see what you think.
          p We arrange childcare at Sparks around into three different age groups: Tiny Sparks (aged 3–5), Little Sparks (5–7) and Big Sparks (8–14). Each group is led by a senior member of staff who is there to ensure children’s wellbeing.
          p For Reception children we offer up to two sessions free of charge to help them get settled in. Please get in touch with us by email at #[a(href='mailto:coopsparks@gmail.com?subject=Introductory session') coopsparks@gmail.com] you would like to arrange an introductory session.
          p We operate within a set of #[a(href=pageUrl('about/policies-procedures/index.jade')) policies and procedures] that are there to make Sparks the best it can be. Please take some time to familiarise yourself with them.
